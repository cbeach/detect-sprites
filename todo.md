# To Do


  [x] Node equality (required for set.issubset)
  [x] manually test node equality
  [x] Node isomorphism
      - node.isomorph(self, other)
        color_hash(self) == color_hash(other) and sprite.neighbors.issubset(self)
  [.] manually test node.isomorph
    - This is actually going to be a little more difficult than I thought since some patches straddle multiple tiles
